                  <p>I had the pleasure of managing Samir at Dinnova AG for the past two years, and I can confidently
                    say he's an exceptional backend developer and team player. <br> <br>

                    What stands out most about Samir is his independence and problem-solving approach. When faced with
                    complex challenges, he doesn't just ask for help. He digs in, does the research, and delivers solid
                    solutions on his own. This made him incredibly reliable across the multiple complex projects we
                    worked on together. <br> <br>
                    Beyond his technical capabilities with Laravel and backend systems, Samir excels at managing people.
                    He took on the responsibility of mentoring junior developers while continuing to contribute
                    significantly as a developer himself. He has that rare combination of strong technical skills and
                    genuine leadership ability. He elevates the team around him without creating unnecessary
                    dependencies. <br> <br>

                    Samir is someone who works best with autonomy, owns his work completely, and collaborates
                    effectively with teammates. He'd be an excellent fit for senior full-stack role where both technical
                    depth and leadership is valued. <br> <br>

                    I highly recommend him.

                    I had the pleasure of working with him as my Project Leader. He has strong expertise in Laravel and
                    Vue.js, and consistently demonstrated a clear understanding of both backend and frontend
                    development. <br> <br>

                    He is highly organized, supportive, and always open to discussions, which makes collaboration smooth
                    and productive. <br> <br>

                    I’m grateful for the opportunity to work with him and would confidently recommend him as a skilled
                    developer and an effective project leader.

                    I had the privilege of working under Samir Raihan at Dinnova AG, where he served as my line manager.
                    Samir is an exceptional engineering leader who combines strong technical expertise with thoughtful
                    people management. <br> <br>

                    He has a clear vision for building scalable, maintainable systems and consistently guided the team
                    toward clean architecture, best practices, and high engineering standards. Samir was always
                    approachable and supportive, whether it was discussing system design, reviewing complex backend
                    logic, or helping unblock challenges under tight deadlines. <br> <br>

                    What truly sets Samir apart is his leadership style. He trusts his team, encourages ownership, and
                    creates an environment where engineers feel confident sharing ideas and taking initiative. His
                    communication with both technical and non-technical stakeholders is clear, respectful, and
                    effective, which greatly contributed to smooth project execution. <br> <br>

                    Samir is not just a strong Laravel and backend leader, but also a mentor who genuinely cares about
                    team growth and collaboration. I’m grateful for the opportunity to work with him and would highly
                    recommend Samir for any senior engineering or leadership role.

                    I worked with Samir Raihan for over a year at Dinnova AG, where I directly managed him across
                    multiple projects. As a Senior Software Engineer and Teamlead of my project, he played a key role in
                    delivering new product features and client driven requirements with strong ownership and quality.
                    <br> <br>

                    Samir is highly responsible, dedicated, and detail oriented, and I could always count on him to
                    deliver on time with a positive attitude. He was one of the most valuable assets of my team, and I
                    strongly recommend him for any engineering leadership role.

                    I had the pleasure of working with Samir Raihan at Dinnova AG Ltd., where we collaborated as
                    teammates on the projects Shine and Skill Match. During this time, Samir consistently demonstrated
                    strong technical expertise as a backend developer. <br> <br>

                    He has a solid understanding of backend architecture, API development, and database management.
                    Samir writes clean, efficient, and maintainable code, and he is always attentive to performance and
                    scalability. His problem-solving skills and logical thinking greatly contributed to the stability
                    and success of our projects. <br> <br>

                    Beyond his technical strengths, Samir is a reliable team player. He communicates clearly, meets
                    deadlines, and is always willing to support teammates when needed. Working with him was both
                    productive and enjoyable. <br> <br>

                    I highly recommend Samir Raihan for any backend development role. I am confident he will be a

                  say he's an exceptional backend developer and team player. <br> <br>

                  What stands out most about Samir is his independence and problem-solving approach. When faced with
                  complex challenges, he doesn't just ask for help. He digs in, does the research, and delivers solid
                  solutions on his own. This made him incredibly reliable across the multiple complex projects we
                  worked on together. <br> <br>
                  Beyond his technical capabilities with Laravel and backend systems, Samir excels at managing people.
                  He took on the responsibility of mentoring junior developers while continuing to contribute
                  significantly as a developer himself. He has that rare combination of strong technical skills and
                  genuine leadership ability. He elevates the team around him without creating unnecessary
                  dependencies. <br> <br>

                  Samir is someone who works best with autonomy, owns his work completely, and collaborates
                  effectively with teammates. He'd be an excellent fit for senior full-stack role where both technical
                  depth and leadership is valued. <br> <br>

                  I highly recommend him.
